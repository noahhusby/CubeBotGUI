# CubeBotGUI

A work-in-progress Rubik's Cube Solving Robot written in C#
Solving algorithm written 100% by me (however based on the Old Pochmann 3BLD method)

# How to use:
 - Download CubeBotGUI from the `bin` folder
 - Open CubeBotGUI with a webcam connected (important)
 - Manually input the cube's state (instructions can be found in `CubeBotRewritten`'s source code)
 - Hit solve
 - Pray for no memory leaks! (If there is one, turn on "speed mode" and try again.
 
# Features
 - Print solution for ANY scramble of a 2x2 cube
